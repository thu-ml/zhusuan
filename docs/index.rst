ZhuSuan
=======

ZhuSuan is a python	library	for	**Generative Models**, built upon Tensorflow.
Unlike existing deep learning libraries, which are mainly designed for
supervised tasks, ZhuSuan is featured for its deep root into Bayesian
Inference, thus supporting various kinds of generative models: both the
traditional **hierarchical Bayesian models** and recent
**deep generative models**.

With ZhuSuan, users can enjoy powerful fitting and multi-GPU training of deep
learning, while at the same time they can use generative models to model the
complex world, exploit unlabeled data and deal with uncertainty by performing
principled Bayesian inference.
